# Farseer Physics Engine

## OpenTK port
This project is my personal port of Farseer Physics to utilize OpenTK primitives over XNA, so it can be better integrated into my personal projects.  It is provided as is.

## What is this?
Farseer Physics is a high performance 2D collision detection system with realistic physics responses.

## What is it good for?
You can create a game, robotic simulatons or even UI feedback systems using this engine and associated tools. Everything from a simple platform game to Marsrover simulations are possible.

## Features
We have tons of features!

* Continuous collision detection (with time of impact solver)
* Contact callbacks: begin, end, pre-solve, post-solve
* Convex and concave polygons and circles.
* Multiple shapes per body
* Dynamic tree and quad tree broadphase
* Fast broadphase AABB queries and raycasts
* Collision groups and categories
* Sleep management
* Friction and restitution
* Stable stacking with a linear-time solver
* Revolute, prismatic, distance, pulley, gear, mouse joint, and other joint types
* Joint limits and joint motors
* Controllers (gravity, force generators)
* Tools to decompose concave polygons, find convex hulls and boolean operations
* Factories to simplify the creation of bodies
